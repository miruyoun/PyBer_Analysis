# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
In this challenge, I provided Pyber decision-makers with additional data, visualizations, and recommendations. First, I created a summary data frame of the ride-sharing data by city type, then a multiple-line graph of the total weekly fares by city type. Finally, with those two, I provided three possible recommendations on improving disparities among city types.

### Summary Dataframe

### Multiple-Line Chart

Based on the summary dataframe and multiple-line plot, we can see large disparties in ride-sharing data between the three city types. The summary dataframe shows total rides, total drivers, and total fares arranged from smallest to largest. The average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fare by city type were, however, arranged from largest to smallest.

Further analysis reveals that the total ride difference between urban and suburban is twice the difference between suburban and rural. The total driver also followed a similar trend, but the difference between urban and suburban was much greater (about 4.6 times greater) than the difference between suburban and rural. Total fares between rural to suburban also increased about 4.6 times, but suburban to urban fares only doubled. In rural areas and suburban areas, the average fare per ride difference was small (about $4) with a slightly larger difference between suburban and urban (about $6). Average fares per driver differed significantly between each city type i.e. the difference between rural and suburban fares is about $16, and the difference between suburban and urban fares is $23. Finally, total fare by city type shows fairly consistent weekly fare per week with fluctuations around late February to early April.

## Summary
The first recommendation I would provide is that if PyBer wants to make the average fare per driver to be consistent in each city type, then I would recommend that they have fewer drivers in urban areas and more drivers in rural areas. Because there aren't enough drivers in rural areas, the fare per driver is very high, while it's very low in urban areas because there are so many drivers.

The second recommendation I would provide is that if PyBer wants to make the average fare per ride more consistent in each city type, then I would recommend that they increase fare prices in urban areas and slightly increase fare prices in suburban areas. Assuming that PyBer wants to maximize profit, then they would increase the fares in those areas to get a higher average fare per ride to match rural areas.

The last recommendation I would provide to PyBer is that between late February and early April, especially in urban and suburban areas, they increase the fare price or limit the number of drivers they have to minimize losses and maximize profits. The fluctuations in weekly fares suggest that there are an inconsistent amount of rides.
